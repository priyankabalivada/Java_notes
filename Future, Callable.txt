Future: we create threadpool executor with some thrads and submit task but to know status of thraead in async mode, we use future

Future is an interface ,
it allows us to check status of computation ,
get the result, 
take care of excetion


---->5 methods
cancel()--if main wanna cancel execution of async task,Hey cancel it!>
isCancelled()-- status check
isDone()--task is done
get()--The caller wait for completion of async task, After task competed retrive result if completed

Submit(runnable), submit(runnable,t), submit(callable)
Callable(): Returns certain value

Runnable,Callable both are same , Has task that is required to be executed.

Callable has return type nd runnable has nothing as such
