HashMap: key-value pair..
Internally Has BUCKETS. Buckets stores these keyvalue pairs.

How does they know which bucket to store?

They compute hashcode of the key and that On that bucket(Index) value these are stored.What if it computes same hashvslue. Then its is called hashcollision.

Hashcollision can be avoided by Linkdin list ot tree datastructure.

map.put() :

String key1 = "ABC";  // Hash code: 64578
String key2 = "XYZ";  // Hash code: 64578 (hypothetical collision)

used TREE oe LINKEDLIST for storage


map.get()

it again computes hashcode of the key and searches in that bucket.The buciet has 2 keys then used EQUALS() method to compare keys and if false then searches for the another key or else that key is the reqyured one.
